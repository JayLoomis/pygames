# On Games and Programming
This is my pygame notes repo, so I'll keep this brief. Making video games is a
topic of its own. Here's a place for me to make notes about what I learn about
making games generally as I go through the process.

## The game loop
Every game has a core logic loop. It generally includes these steps:
1. Perform any preparatory steps.
2. Gather inputs.
3. Process inputs, by updating entities and states.
4. Make changes to the graphics.
5. Update the display
